You should come up with a research question in your group, about one of the following
datasets and propose methods to answer that research question using the concepts that you will
learn during this course or the related data mining concepts.
There are two ways to come up with your project proposal:
1. Come up with a research question and apply the class methods to the datasets to answer
that question. To do that, take a look at the dataset attributes and features. Create a
research question: for example, if you can find interesting patterns using some of the
features or if you can predictsome of the features according to the other ones. Make sure
your research question makes sense in real world. If you are proposing to use the
approachesthat we have seen in the class, exactly asthey are, you should use at least two
of these methods and compare their results. Then, propose a plan on what you will do
when to answer that research question.
2. Focus on a research question that is addressed by a recent research paper. To do this, you
can look up recent research papers that have used these datasets. If the authors of those
research papers have published their code, you can download the code, use it to
experiment on the dataset the same way that the paper has run them, and report the
results of your experiments. Your results will be different from the original paper. In the
project proposal, you should propose a plan on what you will do when to replicate a
specific research paper.
You need a good amount of time to study the dataset or research the papers that have used that
dataset. So, start early before the proposal submission date.
The first dataset is from KKD Cup 2015 (https://biendata.com/competition/kddcup2015/). You can
download the dataset here: http://data-mining.philippe-fournier-viger.com/the-kddcup-2015-

The second one is from Junyi academy. You can find it here:
